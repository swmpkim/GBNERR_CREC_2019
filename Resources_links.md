Some of my favorites are:  

+  `Ctrl` + `Enter`: run current line or selected code  
+  `Ctrl` + `-`:  the assignment operator (`<-`)  
+  `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `c`: comment all selected lines (insert `#` in front)  
+  `Ctrl` + `i`: re-indent selected code
+  `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `i`: insert a code chunk into RMarkdown file  
+  `F2`: shows code used by function
