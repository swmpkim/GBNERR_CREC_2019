## Key Concepts  

+  Split-Apply-Combine concept of data analysis  
+  Wide vs. Long data formats, and when each is useful  
+  Key-value pairs  
+  Exporting data  

## Key functions  

From **`dplyr`**:  

+  `select()` - select certain columns  
+  `filter()` - select rows that meet a certain condition  
+  `%>%` - "the pipe operator" - string together lots of commands!  
+  `mutate()` - add or modify columns  
+  `group_by()` and `summarize()` - calculate summary statistics by group in your data frame  

From **`tidyr`**:  

+  `gather()` and `spread()` - reshape data between wide and long formats
