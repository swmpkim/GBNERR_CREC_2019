## Welcome  

Here's how this workshop will be structured:  

+  half-hour breaks in morning and afternoon  
+  full hour for lunch  
+  colored sticky notes! Put on your computer to signal:   
    +  blue: "I'm finished with the task you gave me"  
    +  orange: "I need some help"  
    
We encourage you to type along; don't just copy and paste from provided scripts  
    

## Ground Rules  

Be respectful  

Help each other  

Go easy on yourself  

## Some vocabulary  

+  Base R / Tidyverse  
+  Packages  
    +  installed *__once__* with **`install.packages("package_name")`**  
    +  loaded *__every time you need them__* with **`library(package_name)`** or *`require(package_name)`*  
    +  **`library`** is better than **`require`**  (https://yihui.name/en/2014/07/library-vs-require/)  
+  Data Frames  
+  Vectors  
+  Objects  
+  Functions  

## Good practices for scripts  

1.  Use scripts.  
2.  Load all libraries (packages) at the top of your script.
